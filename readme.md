## Introduction

See Hear Feel is a desktop application made to convert movies and films to better cater them to the needs of blind and deaf-mute people. This software is made for movie producers and organizations which are involved in the movie business. Our Software will convert provided subtitle files to Sign Language picture-in-picture video for the deaf-mute community. It will also replace the Original Audio of the movie with user-provided Audio Description of the movie so that blind people can have a better understanding of what's going on in the movie and can enjoy the movie.

Once the Movie is recreated after adding Sign Language and Audio Description, Movie producers can easily create a Digital Cinema Package (DCP) and can easily distribute this movie to different cinema theaters across the world.
